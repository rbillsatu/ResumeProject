                Graduated from Russellville High School in 2001 with honors.  Joined the United States Navy in 2003 as an Aviation Structural Mechanic.  Sailed around the world multiple times across four deployments and countless at-sea periods.  Specialized in routine maintenance and repair of hydraulic systems, airframe, and landing gear components of Sikorsky H-60 helicopters. <br><br>
            
                Returned to school and pursued a degree in Mechanical Engineering, but quickly changed major to Information Systems because I have always possessed a profound love of computers.  I am now in my last semester and I will graduate December 2022!

                While in school, I found work at a local business called <a href="https://www.mid-statesign.com">Mid-State Sign and Supply, Inc.</a> where we design and produce signs, vehicle lettering, and vehicle wraps. All work showcased on our website is work that I personally designed, produced, and installed.  In the fall of 2020, the owner decided he wanted to start a trucking business called <a href="https://www.gsplogisticsinc.com">GSP Logistics Inc.</a>  I stood this business up and we now have four trucks that make freight deliveries nationwide.  This is of course the short version of my journey and transition from military to college and civilian life.
